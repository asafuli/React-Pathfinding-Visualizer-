# Pathfinding visualizer

## Purpose

Hopefully this simple project can help develop intuition for how few of the basic pathfinding Algorithms are performing

### Supported Algorithms

Currently supporting:
[1.Depth first search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
[2.Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
[1.A\*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

## How to run?

This project was built with React so simply clone the repository and 'Yarn/npm start' to view it in your localhost

## Online version
